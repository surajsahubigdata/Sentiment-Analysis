# Sentiment-Analysis

This project implements a Sentiment Analysis model using a Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to classify movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as either positive or negative. The dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews, split equally into training and test sets. Text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization and padding were applied to convert the reviews into sequences suitable for the RNN. The RNN model was trained on these sequences to learn temporal dependencies in the text, allowing it to capture contextual sentiment. The model was compiled with categorical cross-entropy loss and optimized using Adam. The resulting model provides insights into how sequential neural networks can be applied for text-based sentiment analysis tasks.
